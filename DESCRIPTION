Description: Prioritize candidate cancer drugs for drug repositioning based on the random walk with restart algorithm in a drug-drug functional similarity network. 1) We firstly constructed a drug-drug functional similarity network by integrating pathway activity and drug activity derived from the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. 2) Secondly, we calculated drug repurposing score according to a set of approved therapeutic drugs of interested cancer based on the random walk with restart algorithm in the drug-drug functional similarity network. 3) Finally, the permutation test was used to calculate the statistical significance level for the drug repurposing score.
